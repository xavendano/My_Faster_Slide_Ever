# Example Presentation with Marp for Visual Studio Code

This repository contains a presentation created with **Marp** using a Markdown file (`.md`) as the main source. The goal is to show, in a simple and practical way, how to structure slides, insert images, tables, and code blocks from a development environment such as Visual Studio Code.

## Example Content

The file includes demonstrations of:

- **Slide separation** using `---`
- **Titles and subtitles**
- **Images and icons** inserted directly into Markdown
- **Tables** with different alignments
- **Code blocks** (Python, HTML, or others) using triple backticks
- **Text in standard Markdown format**

This example is ideal for those who want to get started with Marp or evaluate whether creating presentations from Markdown fits into their workflow.

## Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Marp for VS Code** extension
- (Optional) `icons/` folder included in the project if you want to use the icon shown in the example.
